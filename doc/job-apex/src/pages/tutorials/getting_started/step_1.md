## {$page.title}

Job.apex has a dependency over [R.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/R.apex). We need to firstly include R.apex.

Include **Func.cls**, **R.cls**, and **RTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and R.apex is ready.

Then include Job.apex.

Include **Job.cls**, **JobTest.cls**(optional), **Jobs.cls** and **JobsTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and you are ready to go.
